# Age-Calculator

This project is very good for the basic understanding of the HTML,CSS and JavaScript. 
During the project I learned about the styling of the page.
This project **Age Calculator** is used to calculate your age.
U need tp write your birthyear and it will show your Age.
In this project I used different form features such LABEL,BUTTON which was latter designed with help of CSS.
I also used various Eventlisteners to make it more user-interactive.
The project is very basic but I got to learn various thing during this.

I would give Credit to CodeWithSahand to provide a cousre which was a valuable assistant during this project.
